# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
In this Peer Graded Assignment, we performed certain actions to get the tidydata and did some changes so as to make it easy to read the data.
For creating the tidydata, we created the R script follwing these actions:

-Mergeing the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-From the data set in step 4, we created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This second tidy data is also uploaded on this folder for the verification.
